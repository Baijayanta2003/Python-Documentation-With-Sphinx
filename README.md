## Python-Documentation-With-Sphinx
In this I will guide you step by step how to *make* documentation for your python codes and make them in different format and make html or pdf or tex files.

## Here are the steps:

1.First install a virtual environment using the command in your terminal command

```bash
python -m venv myenv

```
you can write thing instead of myenv.This can create a directiory where your virtual environment will be.

2.Activate the virtual environment.

```bash
 source myenv/bin/activate
```

after that you will see a line `After activation, you should see (myenv) in your command prompt`
4.Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install <package_name>
```
install all the packages you need.
5.To deactiavte the virtual environment type
```bash
deactivate
```
viola you have successfully installed used and exited the virtual environment.
